# Elevate Labs Task 7: Basic Sales Summary using SQLite and Python

This task involves connecting a Python script to a SQLite database to retrieve and visualize sales data.

## Files Included

- `sales_data.db`: A sample SQLite database with dummy sales data.
- `sales_summary.py`: A Python script that queries the database and plots the revenue by product.
- `sales_chart.png`: The output chart generated by the script (after running it).

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed with `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `sqlite3` (built-in).
2. Place `sales_data.db` and `sales_summary.py` in the same folder.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python sales_summary.py
```

## Output

- A printed table showing total quantity sold and total revenue for each product.
- A bar chart saved as `sales_chart.png`.

## Learning Outcomes

- How to connect Python to SQLite.
- How to run basic SQL queries in Python.
- How to use `pandas` and `matplotlib` for data analysis and visualization.
